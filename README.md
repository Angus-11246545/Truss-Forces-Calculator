# Truss-Forces-Calculator

A calculator for simple truss structures.

bridges.py stores the Bridge class that can be imported, with sub classes for members and joints as well as a few functions to add & calculated forces, find truss determinancy and other stuff.
The wk4_WHATEVER_example1.py files are examples of truss structures used in tutorials and lectures. I used these to test the program
prelimDesign.py are the truss structures I'm testing. The dimensions are not exact.
